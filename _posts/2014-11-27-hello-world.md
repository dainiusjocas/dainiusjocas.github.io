Hi, my name is Dainius and I'm a software developer. I'll use this blog to share my thoughts, experience and excitement about building software.

Recently, I've started working with Clojure. So, my everyday tasks are deeply mixed with learning how Clojure works. I like to learn that kind of stuff. Also, I believe that that repetition is the mother of all learning. Therefore, in this blog I'm going to reiterate over things that I think are important.

One of the main reasons I think software engineering is cool, is because there are many big ideas floating around. To understand ideas better, it is a good exercise to describe them to a friend or just to write them down. Therefore, this blog will serve as a notepad for ideas.

To sum up, likely topics for this blog are:
* hacks;
* concepts;
* discoveries;
* books;
* experience of working with frameworks and libraries;
* etc.
